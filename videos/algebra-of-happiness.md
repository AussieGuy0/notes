- It's common that happiness takes a dip in in your mid 20's to early 40's as
  the stress of life takes a toll. It goes back up in your late 40's. "Happiness
  waits for you".
- The ratio of the amount you sweat vs you watch someone as sweat is an
  indicator of success.
  
- One of the most important decisions is who you'll partner with for the rest of
  your life. It's vitally important to have someone that shares your mindset and
  goals.
- Passion (Physical attraction)
- Values (Religion, kids, responsibilities) 
- Money (Similar expectations for money in and out)

- Money makes you happier...to a point. 
- Take note on what gives you joy and satisfaction, and invest in those things.

- Compound interest
- Invest young!

- Find your way to feel masculine
- "Be a man, not a boy in a mans body"

- Equity = Wealth
- Buy property, shares early on
- The definition of rich: Passive Income > Expenditure 
- Young people focus on their salary, adults focus on their 'burn' (Expenditure)

- In a large study, the presence of alcohol was the single biggest indicator of
  a unhappy person.

- Experiences > Things
- Happiness = Family

- The key to success is the ability to mourn, and move on.
