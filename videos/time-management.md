## Goals, Priorities and Planning
- Why am I doing this? What is the goal?
- Why will I succeed?
- What happens if I chose not to do it?
- Doing things right vs doing the right things
- 100 things to do in my life

## Planning
- Failing to plan is planning to fail
- Plan each day, each week, each semester
- Can always change plan (but have one first)

## Todo List
- Breakdown things into small steps
- Do the ugliest thing first

## Cove's 4 quad TODO

|              |Due now|Due later|
|--------------|-------|---------|
|Important     |  1    |    2    |
|Not-Important |  3    |    4    |

## Time Journal
- Monitor yourself in 15 minute increments for between 3 days and two weeks
- Update every 1/2 hour
- What am I doing that doesn't need to be done, can be delegated etc.

## Procrastinating
- Make up fake deadline to get things done
- Identify why I'm procrastinating
