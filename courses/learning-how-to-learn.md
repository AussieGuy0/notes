## Modes
Focused: Help keep thoughts concentrated. Used for when using problems that we are familar with.
Diffuse: Letting your mind wander. Making unconcious connections. Good for learing new things.

## Practice
1. Study hard by foocusing intently
2. Take break/Focus on something else
3. Repeat 

Spaced practice is better than craming. 

## Chunking
Individual pieces of information bound together in a meaningful whole. Good as it allows people to store more than 7 +- 2 things in working memory.

1. Full attention on the information you want to understand
2. Understand the basic idea you want to chunk
3. Context, knowing when to use the chunk.

Practicing and recalling is better than re-reading a book/article.

Testing and making mistakes is good.

Learning things from outside the normal study area, as you become independent of any cues that exist in your 'normal' room.

Chunks in one subject help develop chunks in other subjects.

**Overlearning**: Practicing something over and over again does not strengthen concepts, need to keep going onto harder challenges.

**Einstellung**: Initial thought/idea/intution prevents better ideas from being found.

**Interleaving**: Swap to different concepts during practice. 

## Procrastinating
Keep planner journal so what works/doesn't work can be tracked.

Habits/Zombie Mode. The mode the brain goes in when doing something we know how to really well.

1. The cue. (Location, Time, How you feel, reactions)
2. The routine. The "zombie mode". 
3. The reward. The feeling of pleasure.
3. The belief. Why you think the habit/why you can't change it

Put negative feelings aside. 

Focus on process (Lets spend 20 minutes work), not product (Finish the asignment). Allows to relax into the flow of work instead of worring about if the product will be finished.

To change habit, change reaction to cue.

## Juggling life a learning
- Weekly list of key tasks
- Daily "to do" list (evening before)

Do hardest, most disliked task first.

## Memory
Spaced repetition allows long term memories to form better.

Visual memory is our strongest memory.

Short term memory becomes long term memory via rensolidation

## How to Become Better Learner
Exercise more effective than any other drug to help learn better.

## Testing checklist
- Start on a hard problem then switch to an easy problem. This triggers the diffuse mode and allows you to tackle the hard problem easier when you switch back to it.
